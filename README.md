# Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python

This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple and classic encryption technique. It allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting each letter by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

## Required Module:
   . PyperClip
   . String

## How to Run the Python Script

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Kushagra0686/Shifter
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```
   cd PRODIGY_CS_01
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```
   python shifter.py
   ```

4. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions:**  
   - Enter your message to encrypt or decrypt.
   - Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.
   - Input the shift value.

5. **View the Result:**
   - The encrypted or decrypted message will be displayed.

## Cipher Explanation 🕵️‍♂️

### What is Caesar Cipher? 🔑
Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher technique where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

### Encryption Process 🔒
1. **Input Message:**  
   - You provide a message to encrypt.
  
2. **Shift Operation:**  
   - Each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions.
  
3. **Output Cipher:**  
   - The encrypted message is produced.

### Decryption Process 🔓
1. **Input Cipher:**  
   - You provide the encrypted message.
  
2. **Reverse Shift Operation:**  
   - Each letter in the encrypted message is shifted back by the same number of positions.
  
3. **Output Deciphered Message:**  
   - The original message is revealed.

### Example Usage 📝
- Encrypting the message "HELLO" with a shift of 3:  
  - Plain text: HELLO  
  - Cipher text: KHOOR
  
- Decrypting the cipher "KHOOR" with a shift of 3:  
  - Cipher text: KHOOR  
  - Plain text: HELLO

## Features 🚀
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Supports both encryption and decryption.
- Adjustable shift value for custom encryption strength.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
